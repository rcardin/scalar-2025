# Who Am I?

# Why We ❤️ Functional Programming

* We have the **substitution model** for reasoning about programs
```scala 3
def plusOne(i: Int): Int = i + 1
def timesTwo(i: Int): Int = plusOne(plusOne(i))
```
* The substitution model enables **local reasoning** and **referential transparency**
  * We don't need to look at the implementation
  * Original program and the substituted program are *equivalent*
* We call these functions *pure* functions
---

# We Live in an Imperfect World 💔

> Model a coin toss, but with a twist: the gambler might be too drunk and lose the coin

```scala 3
import scala.util.Random

def drunkFlip(): String = {
  val caught = Random.nextBoolean()
  val heads =
    if (caught) Random.nextBoolean()
    else throw new Exception("We dropped the coin")
  if (heads) "Heads" else "Tails"
}
```

---

# We Live in an Imperfect World 💔

* We can't use the substitution model for all programs
  * If the `drunkFlip` function throws an _exception_, the substitution model breaks

* Programs that interact with a context outside the function
  * The result of the `drunkFlip` function depends on the state of the world

* Multiple calls to `drunkFlip` can return different results

---

# Side Effects

* **Side Effect**: An unpredictable change in the state of the world
  * *Unmanaged*, they just happen

```scala 3
// What happens if b is equal to zero?
def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a / b
```

* We call `divide` an *impure* function
* The best we can do is to *track* and push them to the _boundaries_ of our system

---

# The Effect Pattern

When a side effect is _tracked_ and _controlled_ we call it an **effect**
  1. The _type_ of the function should tell us what effects it can perform and what's the type of the result
    - The `drunkFlip` deals with _non-determinism_ and _errors_
  2. We must separe the _description_ from making it happen
    - We want a _recipe_ of the program.
    - **Deferred execution** & **referential transparency**

The pattern lets us use the **substitution model** again 🚀 🎉

---

# An Effect Example

Effects have the form of a generic type `F[A]`

* The `Option[A]` type models the conditional lack of a value 

```scala 3
val maybeInt: Option[Int] = Some(42)
val maybeString: Option[String] = maybeInt.map(_.toString)
```
* Composing function returning effects is not trivial
  * `F[_]` must be a _monad_ so we can use `flatMap` and `map`
  * Different monads are _hard to compose_ (Monad Transformers)

---

# Effect Systems

An **Effect System** is the implementation of the _Effect Pattern_

* It puts side effects in a _box_
* It replaces side effecting operation in standard libraries
* It provides structures to manage effects

In an effect system, a side effect 👎 becomes an effect 👍

---

# Cats Effect

* Cats Effect uses the `IO[A]` data type to model effects
  * `IO[A]` is a _über effect_ that models any effectful computation that returns a value of type `A` and can fail with a `Throwable`
  * It's a _monad_ so we must use `flatMap` and `map` to compose effectful functions
  * `IO[A]` is **referentially transparent** and **lazy** 
  * Redefines the effectul part of the Standard Library
  * Implements _structured concurrency_

---

# Cats Effect

Let's rewrite the `drunkFlip` function using `IO` effect

```scala 3
def drunkFlip: IO[String] =
  for {
    random <- Random.scalaUtilRandom[IO]
    caught <- random.nextBoolean
    heads <-
      if (caught) random.nextBoolean
      else IO.raiseError(RuntimeException("We dropped the coin"))
  } yield if (heads) "Heads" else "Tails"
```
The `drunkFlip` function returns a _recipe_ of the program

---

# Cats Effect

The library provides many ways to _run_ the effect

```scala 3
object Main extends IOApp.Simple {
  def run: IO[Unit] = drunkFlip.flatMap(result => IO.println(result))
}
```
There are also some _unsafe_ methods to run the effect

```scala 3
val result: String = drunkFlip.unsafeRunSync()
val resultF: Future[String] = drunkFlip.unsafeToFuture()
```
---

# Cats Effect

The `IO[A]` hides the exactly performed side effects. We can make them explicit using _Tagless Final_ syntax

```scala 3
def drunkFlipF[F[_]: Random: [G[_]] =>> MonadError[G, String]]: F[String] =
  for {
    caught <- Random[F].nextBoolean
    heads <-
      if (caught) Random[F].nextBoolean
      else ApplicativeError[F, String].raiseError("We dropped the coin")
  } yield if (heads) "Heads" else "Tails"
```
The cognitive load is higher, here 😱

___

# ZIO
* `ZIO[R, E, A]` introduces the errors type `E` and dependencies `R` in the effect definition
  * It's still a monad on the `A` type (`map` and `flatMap`)
  * It provides a _rich algebra_ on the `ZIO` type to avoid monad transformers
  * It's a _referentially transparent_ and _lazy_ effect
  * It provides _structured concurrency_ primitives
  * ...still a über effect

---

# ZIO

The `drunkFlip` function using `ZIO` effect is the following

```scala 3
def drunkFlip: ZIO[Random, String, String] =
  for {
    caught <- Random.nextBoolean
    heads <-
      if (caught) Random.nextBoolean
      else ZIO.fail("We dropped the coin")
  } yield if (heads) "Heads" else "Tails"
```

**Effects are _explicit_** in the `R` type and we can fail with _custom errors_

---

# ZIO

Running the effect means providing needed dependencies or _layers_ 

```scala 3
object Main extends ZIOAppDefault {
  override def run =
    drunkFlip.flatMap { result =>
      Console.printLine(result)
    }.provideLayer(ZLayer.succeed(RandomLive))
}
```

* We can use intersection type: `Random & Console`
* We must fullfil _all the dependencies_ at once to run the effect

---

# Kyo: Meet Algebraic Effects

What if we can have types _listing Effect separately_ and _handling_ them virtually _once at time_?

**Algebraic Effects and Handlers** do exactly that 🎉
 * The type of the function tells us exactly what effects it uses
 * **Kyo** is a novel library implementing Algebraic Effects

```scala 3
def drunkFlip: String < (IO & Abort[String]) = ???
```

---

# Kyo: Meet Algebraic Effects

* Each effect has its own _rich algebra_ to describe the operations

```scala 3
import kyo.*

def drunkFlip: String < (IO & Abort[String]) = for {
  caught <- Random.nextBoolean
  heads  <- if (caught) Random.nextBoolean else Abort.fail("We dropped the coin")
} yield if (heads) "Heads" else "Tails"
```

* Kyo uses a _monad_ to represent the effectful computation
  * We still have to use `flatMap` and `map` 

---

# Kyo: Meet Algebraic Effects

We can decide to _handle each effect separately_ (no über effect)

```scala 3
val partialResult: Result[String, String] < IO = Abort.run { drunkFlip }
```

* `Abort.run` is called an **Effect Handler**
  * It executes the `Abort` effect. The `IO` effect is _left untouched_

* Virtually, we can define a our own effect handler without changing original recipe
  * For example, for testing purposes
---

# Make Your Own Effects System 🛠️

* All the effect systems we've seen are based on _monads_ properties to _compose effectful functions_
  * They use _for-comprehension_ style to give an imperative flavor to a sequence of `flatMap` and `map` calls

What if we could create an effect system that _doesn't rely on monads_, but almost preserves _referential transparency_?

# 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 

---

# Model the Effects' Algebra 🛠️

We'll focus on the `drunkFlip` example. We need effects that model non-determinism (`Random`), errors (`Raise`), and output (`Output`)

```scala 3
trait Random {
  def nextBoolean: Boolean // <- Algebra of the effect
}
trait Raise[-E] { // <- `E` represents the error type
  def raise(error: => E): Nothing
}
trait Output {
  def printLn(line: String): Unit
}
```

---

# Access Std Library as an Effect

We need now to wrap the standard library with the effects

```scala 3
object Random {
  private val unsafe = new Random {
    override def nextBoolean: Boolean = scala.util.Random.nextBoolean()
  }
}
```
We call the variable `unsafe` ☣️ because it gives _direct_, _uncontrolled_ access to the side effect 

___

# Access Std Library as an Effect

We want to give tracked access to the side effect. Let's add some functions (a DSL) to our `object Random`

```scala 3
object Random {
    def nextBoolean(using r: Random): Boolean = r.nextBoolean
}
```

To generate a random `Boolean`, we need to _provide_ an instance of the `Random` effect. We can call it a **capability**
* Calling `Random.nextBoolean` produces a _recipe_ of the program

---

# Access Std Library as an Effect

Let's do the same for the `Ouptut` effect. We'll implement the `Raise[E]` effect later

```scala 3
object Output {
  def printLn(line: String)(using o: Output): Unit = o.printLn(line)
  val unsafe = new Output {
    override def printLn(line: String): Unit = Console.println(line)
  }
}
```

_Trivia_: The Scala `Console.println` object _doesn't throw any exceptions_ in case of errors 🤷‍♂️

---

# Wrap It All Together

We have now all th bricks to build the `drunkFlip` function again 🙌

```scala 3
def drunkFlip(using Random, Raise[String]): String = {
    val caught = Random.nextBoolean
    val heads  = 
      if (caught) Random.nextBoolean 
      else Raise.raise("We dropped the coin")
    if (heads) "Heads" else "Tails"
  }
```

Is it magic? Variables `caught` and `heads` are treated as `Boolean`?! 🤯

---

# Welcome Context Functions 👋

* Scala 3 introduces **Context Functions**, fancy anonymous functions with only _implicit context parameters_

```scala 3
val program: (Raise[String], Random) ?=> String = drunkFlip
```

* Treated as **values** in contexts with the same implicit parameters
  * However, they are _recipes_ to obtain the result

```scala 3
def drunkFlip(using Random, Raise[String]): String = {
  val caught: Boolean = Random.nextBoolean // 🤯
```

---

# Welcome Context Functions 👋

Behind the scenes, the Scala compiler rewrites the context function using a _surrogate type, not visible to the user_

```scala 3
trait ContextFunctionN[-T1, ..., -TN, +R]:
  def apply(using x1: T1, ..., xN: TN): R
```

Our `program` is rewritten as:

```scala 3
val program: new ContextFunction2[Raise[String], Random, String] {
  def apply(using Raise[String], Random): String = drunkFlip
}
```

---

# Handle the Effects

* Handlers are the structures that effectively _run_ effectful functions

```scala 3
object Raise {
  def raise[E](error: => E)(using r: Raise[E]): Nothing = r.raise(error)
  def run[E, A](program: Raise[E] ?=> A): E | A =
    boundary {
      given r: Raise[E] = new Raise[E] {
        override def raise(error: => E): Nothing = break(error)
      }
      program
    }
}
```

---

# Handle the Effects

* The Handler for the `Raise[E]` effect provides the `given` instance of the context parameter
  * We used the `boundary` and `break` functions to _control_ the effect

```scala 3
val program: Random ?=> String = Raise.run { drunkFlip }
```

* The `Raise.run` handler _runs_ the `Raise` effect, leaving the `Random` effect _untouched_ 🥷
  * It's _curryfication_, but on a context parameters level
---

# Handle the Effects

* Changing the handler changes the _behavior_ of the program
  * We can handle a `Raise[E] ?=> A` as an `Either[E, A]`

```scala 3
object Raise {
  def either[E, A](program: Raise[E] ?=> A): Either[E, A] =
    boundary {
      given r: Raise[E] = new Raise[E] {
        override def raise(error: => E): Nothing = break(Left(error))
      }
      Right(program)
    }
}
```

---

# Handle the Effects

Implementing the `Output` and `Random` handlers is quite easy

```scala 3
object Random {
  def run[A](program: Random ?=> A): A = program(using Random.unsafe)
  // Omissis
}

object Output {
  def run[A](program: Output ?=> A): A = program(using Output.unsafe)
  // Omissis
}
```

---

# Handle the Effects

* We can run all the effects of the `drunkFlip` function _stacking_ the handlers
  * We should do it at the _boundaries_ of the system

```scala 3
val result: Either[String, String] = Random.run { 
  Raise.either { 
    drunkFlip 
  } 
}
```
...and we're done 🎉

---

# Properties of the Effect System

* We can say this Effect System uses a **Capability Passing Style**
* It implements the _Effect Pattern_
  * The type tells us the used _effects_ and the type of the _result_
  * The execution is _deferred_

```scala 3
type Effect[E, A] = E ?=> A
```

* Handling effects at the _boundaries_ of the system, we can use the **substitution model** again* 🚀

---

# Where's my `IO` Effect?

* Sometimes bad things happen. _Unpredictable_ errors are thrown
* We want to execute an effectful function in a _dedicated process_

```scala 3
trait IO {}// Maybe Deferred would be a better name

object IO {
  def apply[A](program: => A): IO ?=> A = program
  def runBlocking[A](program: IO ?=> A): Try[A] = {
    val es: ExecutorService = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()
    Try { es.submit(() => program(using new IO {})).get() }
  }
}
```

---

# Where's my `IO` Effect?

* We can use Java Virtual Threads
  * Virtual Threads are implemented using _continuations_
  * They represent _fibers_ 🧶, or _green threads_ on the JVM
  * From Java 24, they are safe also for `synchronized` blocks 🎉
  * They support _structured concurrency_ 🤝

```scala 3
val program: IO ?=> Int = IO {
  42  / 0
}
val result: Try[Int] = IO.runBlocking { program }
```

---

# Bonus Track

What if we can define `flatMap` and `map` in our Effect System 🤓?

We need to play some tricks. Let's define a class sorrounding an effect and implement the `flatMap` and `map` function on it

```scala 3
final class Effect[F](val unsafe: F)
object Effect {
  extension [F, A](eff: Effect[F] ?=> A) {
    inline def flatMap[B](inline f: A => Effect[F] ?=> B): Effect[F] ?=> B = f(eff)
    inline def map[B](inline f: A => B): Effect[F] ?=> B = eff.flatMap(a => f(a))
  }
}
```

---

# Bonus Track

We need to refactor the effects and the handlers accordingly (the refactor of the `Raise[E]` effect is omitted)

```scala 3
object Random {
  def nextBoolean(using r: Effect[Random]): Boolean = r.unsafe.nextBoolean

  def run[A](program: Effect[Random] ?=> A): A = program(using unsafe)

  val unsafe = new Effect(new Random {
    override def nextBoolean: Boolean = scala.util.Random.nextBoolean()
  })
}
```

---

# Bonus Track

We can rewrite the `drunkFlip` function using the new DSL:

```scala 3
def drunkFlip: (Effect[Random], Effect[Raise[String]]) ?=> String = for {
  caught <- Random.nextBoolean
  heads <-
    if (caught) Random.nextBoolean
    else Raise.raise("We dropped the coin")
} yield if (heads) "Heads" else "Tails"
```

If we substitute `inline` functions, we return to the version of `drunkFlip` that doesn't use the `Effect` class 🪄✨

---

# Conclusions

* We defined what is a _side effect_ and why we don't like it
* We introduced the _Effect Pattern_ and the _Effect Systems_ to manage side effects in a controlled way
* We explored the _Cats Effect_ and _ZIO_ libraries as examples of _über effects_
* We introduced the _Kyo_ library as an example of _Algebraic Effects_
* We built our own _Effect System_ on top of _Context Functions_
* We saw how we can still define `flatMap` and `map` in our _Effect System_
