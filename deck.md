# Who Am I?

# Why We ‚ù§Ô∏è Functional Programming

* We have the **substitution model** for reasoning about programs
```scala 3
def plusOne(i: Int): Int = i + 1
def timesTwo(i: Int): Int = plusOne(plusOne(i))
```
* The substitution model enables **local reasoning**
  * No need to look at the implementation
* ...and **referential transparency**
  * Original program and the substituted program are *equivalent*

---

# We Live in an Imperfect World

* We can't use the substitution model for all programs

```scala 3
// We can't substitute `println` with a call to ()
val x: Unit = println("Hello World")
// Every execution of Random.nextInt() is different
val y: Int = Random.nextInt() 
```

* Programs that interact with a context outside the function
```scala 3
def foo(): Unit = ??? // Does it launch a rocket? üò±
```
---

# Side Effects

* **Side Effect**: An unpredictable change in the state of the world
  * *Unmanaged*, they just happen

```scala 3
// What happens if b is equal to zero?
def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a / b
```

* We call `divide` as an *impure* function
* The best we can do is to *track* them and push them to the boundaries of our system
